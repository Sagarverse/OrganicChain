## Slide 2: The Problem 💔
**Visual**: Split screen - left shows fake organic label, right shows worried consumer

### Bullet Points:
- 🚨 **30% of "organic" products are fraudulent**
- 💰 **$500M annual industry cost**
- ❓ **Zero consumer verification ability**
- 📦 **Supply chains are black boxes**
- ⏱️ **3-5 days to trace contaminated products**
- 🔍 **No real-time authenticity checks**

**Impact Statement**: *"Consumers pay premium prices but have no way to verify what they're buying."*

**Suggested Visual**: Infographic showing fake organic certification, confused consumer at grocery store, opaque supply chain diagram

## 💡 Presentation Tips

### Before You Present:
- [ ] Test live demo 3 times
- [ ] Have backup screenshots ready
- [ ] Time yourself (aim for 6:30 to allow Q&A)
- [ ] Practice transitions between slides
- [ ] Memorize key numbers (30%, $500M, 3 seconds)

### During Presentation:
- **Energy**: High enthusiasm, show passion for the problem
- **Eye Contact**: Look at judges, not screen
- **Pacing**: 30 seconds per slide (except demo slides)
- **Body Language**: Open gestures, confidence
- **Voice**: Clear, varied tone (not monotone)

### Demo Best Practices:
- **Always have fallback**: If MetaMask fails, show video recording
- **Explain as you go**: Don't let silence hang while transactions confirm
- **Highlight UI**: Point to glassmorphism effects, animations
- **Show fraud detection**: Product #6 with low score is your secret weapon

### Q&A Preparation:
Expect these questions:
1. **"How do you prevent farmers from lying?"**
   - Answer: IoT sensors automate data, inspectors verify certificates, anomaly detection flags inconsistencies
   
2. **"What about gas fees?"**
   - Answer: Using Polygon for mainnet (costs <$0.01), batch transactions, Layer 2 scaling
   
3. **"How is this better than a database?"**
   - Answer: Immutability prevents tampering, multi-party trust without central authority, consumer verifiable
   
4. **"Revenue model?"**
   - Answer: B2B SaaS ($99-$1999/mo), transaction fees ($0.10/verification), enterprise licensing

5. **"Competitors?"**
   - Answer: IBM Food Trust (expensive, no consumer access), OriginTrail (complex), Farmtrace (manual). We're faster, cheaper, consumer-focused.
